# Runs ANY console command and writes its exit code into the log as the last line, from the one
# process that owns the log stream. This is posture 3 of the three named in spec v0.33:
#   1. `exe > log` then `echo EXIT` to the console  -> the code is not in the artifact at all
#   2. `exe > log` then `echo >> log`               -> re-countable, but code and child are two
#      separate transactions: an interrupt between them leaves a log without a code
#   3. this script                                  -> child output and the code land in one stream,
#      held by one writer; there is no window in which the log exists without the code being due
#
# Why a second script when run-gate.ps1 exists: run-gate.ps1 pins the section 12.8 gate exe on
# purpose (its two witnesses are ledgered under that name). Everything else in the battery -- the dialect
# suite, `dotnet build` -- was still writing codes with posture 2. This script retires posture 2
# for them; it hardcodes nothing.
#
# The child's exit code is data, not failure: the script re-exits with it, so in task systems that
# treat "exit != 0" as failed, a normal 5-red gate run will show as failed. The judge is the
# `EXIT=` line in the log, not the runner's color.
#
# Child stdout/stderr are copied as raw bytes (no PowerShell recoding), like the other two scripts,
# which is what keeps CJK readable in the log.
#
# -Arg is joined with single spaces into the child's raw command line. When this script is invoked
# through `powershell -File`, comma arrays do NOT survive argv binding (measured: `-Arg a,b` arrives
# as ONE token "a,b"), so pass the whole command line as ONE quoted string with real spaces:
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/run-and-log.ps1 -Exe tests/FastSql.Tests.Dialects/bin/Release/net10.0/FastSql.Tests.Dialects.exe -Log obj/logs/v33-dialects-3.log
#   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/run-and-log.ps1 -Exe dotnet -Arg "build FastSql.slnx -c Release --no-incremental" -Log obj/logs/v33-build-3.log
